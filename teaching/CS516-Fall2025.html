										<h2>Responsible Data Science and Algorithmic Fairness (CS 516)---Fall 2025</h2>
										<p><a href="./Syllabus-CS516.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a></p>
									</header>

									<h3>Course Description</h3>
									<p>This course views data-driven and algorithmic decision-making through the lens of safety, accountability, and fairness.
									We first explore the context under which a data-driven software solution operates. This includes fundamentals of engineering and operating data-driven software such as requirements and validation. Then, the course covers responsible data-driven software development. While a major focus of the course will be on Algorithmic Fairness, other aspects such as robustness, interpretability, accountability, explainability, transparency, and trust, etc. will also be covered.
                                    </p>
									
									<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
									<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
									<ul>
                                        <li> What are the key elements of data-driven software? How to reliably develop and maintain data-driven software? </li>
                                        <li>Which qualities matter beyond a model’s prediction accuracy? How can we identify and measure important quality requirements, including learning and inference latency, operating cost, scalability, explainablity, fairness, privacy, robustness, and safety?</li>
                                        <li>How to test, debug, and repair production ML systems? How can we evaluate the quality of a model's predictions in production? How can we test the entire AI-enabled system, not just the model? What lessons can we learn from software testing, automated test case generation, simulation, and continuous integration for testing for production machine learning?</li>
                                        <li>What does it take to build responsible products? How to think about fairness of a production system at the model and system level? How to mitigate safety and security concerns? How can we communicate the reasons of an automated decision or explain uncertainty to users?</li>
										<li> What are the key responsible requirements in data-driven software? How to define and measure fairness? How to develop interpretability by design? How to perform post-hoc explainability techniques? Who is accountable for software failures?
										</li>
										<li> What does it take to build responsible data-driven software? How to think about the fairness of such a system at the model and system level? What are the fairness issues in pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing stage of data-driven software solutions?
										</li>
