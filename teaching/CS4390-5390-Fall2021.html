                                    <h3>Course Description</h3>
                                    <p>Data-driven software is growing fast and has pervasively applied in critical domains such as self-driving car, malware detection, medical software, hiring, and criminal justice. Since this application learns the decision logic from passive historical data, they are prone to security vulnerabilities, privacy leaks, and fairness bugs when deployed in security-critical and socially critical applications.</p>

                                    <p>The primary goal of this course is to study the opportunities and challenges in deploying data-driven solutions. After covering the basics of machine learning (ML) such as decision trees and deep neural networks, students explore topics related to robustness and fairness of ML algorithms. Then, they study the application of data-driven solutions to improve security and reliability of traditional software.</p>
