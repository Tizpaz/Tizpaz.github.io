                                    <h3>Course Description</h3>
                                    <p>Responsible AI is a cross-list special topic course. The primary goal of this course is to study safe, responsible, and trustworthy AI. In previous courses, students have studied computer security, software systems, and machine learning/data mining/AI. In this class, we will explore safety, security, and ethical concerns in AI. After covering the basics such as trust, safety, data, AI software lifecycle, supervised learning, causal logic, generative AI, and large language models; we study responsible AI topics such as privacy, adversarial robustness, distribution shifts, fairness, risks of foundational models (e.g., ChatGPT), Interpretability, Explainability, Transparency, and AI Alignment problem.</p>

                                    <p>The primary goal of this course is to study the opportunities and challenges in deploying AI Software. After covering the basics, students explore topics related to safety, security, robustness, privacy, fairness of AI.</p>
