									<h3>Diversity and Inclusion in RISC Lab</h3>

                                        Dr. Tizpaz-Niari and RISC lab at UTEP are committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for all. 
                                        They believe that a diverse and knowledgeable software and AI engineering workforce plays a critical role in safeguarding Responsible AI values.
                                        In addition, Dr. Tizpaz-Niari firmly emphasizes that such values differ across different communities.
                                        Hence, understanding the perception and prioritization
                                        of Responsible AI values from diverse communities is critical.   
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To increase the participation of underrepresented groups in computing, we are actively recruiting students from all diverse backgrounds and encouraging them to apply.
                                        In addition, we are actively engaged in outreach activities to promote Responsible AI values and the knowledge of current/future workforce:
