                                    <strong>Accountable and Fair Computing</strong>
                                    </br>
                                    Discriminatory software is a critical issue in the automated decision-support systems. 
									For example, Parole decision-making software was found to harm black and Hispanic defendants by falsely predicting a higher risk of recidivism than non-Hispanic white defendants;
									Amazon's hiring algorithm disproportionately rejected more female applicants than male applicants;
									and IRS audited black taxpayers at much higher rates than other racial groups. 
									Thus, it is of paramount importance to detect, explain, and mitigate software discrimination in order to improve trustworthiness and minimize their harm to vulnerable communities. 
									<i>My central research goal is to devise principled testing and debugging methods to improve fairness in software.</i>

                                    <strong>ML Performance fuzzing and debugging</strong>
                                    </br>
									Building a tool that can detect and explain performance bugs is difficult when dealing with a large system.
									We are developing DPFuzz, an approach that combines software engineering with machine learning to identify different classes of performances and explain root causes in terms of program internals. The approach has been successfully applied to large scale python and Java libraries and has since identified bugs in the implementations of popular and critical libraries.
                                    </br>
                                    This project aims to leverage tools and techniques from software engineering, machine learning, and social science to address ethical and legal concerns in cyber systems under uncertainty. 
                                    </br>

									<strong>Fuzz Testing for Security</strong>
									</br>
									Confidentiality and privacy are critical requirements of software. However, software might contaitn vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to leak sensitive information.
									The key idea is to devise novel fuzzing techniques that can automatically generate test cases that can be used to detect and debug privacy vulnerabilities in software.
                                    </br>
