                                    Saeid Tizpaz-Niari is an Assistant Professor of CS at UT El Paso and director of RISC lab.
                                    He received his PhD from the ECEE department at University of Colorado Boulder in 2020.
                                    His research interests are at the intersection of Software Engineering, Machine Learning,
                                    and Security. He is the first author of multiple publications in top tier Software Engineering,
                                    Security, AI, and Verification conferences. He develops tools and techniques to address confidentiality leaks,
                                    denial-of-service issues, and fairness bugs. His findings help discover multiple performance bugs in popular ML
                                    libraries such as scikit-learn and timing side-channel vulnerabilities in critical Java
                                    libraries such as OpenJDK.
                                    In 2018, he received the Gold Research Award from the ECEE department at CU Boulder.
                                    In addition, he won second prize for his submission to the First Microsoft Open Source
                                    Challenge. Prior to his PhD, he obtained an MS degree from CE department at Sharif University
                                    of Technology in 2013 and BS degree (with first-class honor) from ECE department of Tabriz University
                                    in 2011.
